# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
# print(len(fruits))
# # Challenge:
# # Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
# print(fruits[0])
# print(fruits[1])
# print(fruits[2])
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
# # i just worked with loops

# # Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
# print(len(subjects))
# for subject in subjects:
#     print(subject)

# for subject in subjects:
#     print(subject)
#     if subject == "History":
#         break
#     else:
#         print(subject)


# for subject in subjects:
#     if subject == "Science":
#         continue
#     else: 
#         print(subject)
    # for index in range(len(subjects)):
    #     print("Subject "+ str(index) + ": " + subjects[index])

    # numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
    # total = 0
    # for number in numbers:
    #     total += number
    # print("total: ", total)

    # # Challenge:
    # # Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
    # # Example output: "Subject 0: Math"


    # # Given:
    # numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

    # # Challenge:
    # # Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
    # new_total = 0
    # new_numbers = list(range(1,600001))
    # for number in new_numbers:
    #     total += str(new_numbers)
    # print("total: ", new_total)
